It was initially used to make moulds or prototypes, however, its use expanded due to its accurate and reproducible design capabilities in a range of materials. This allowed faster fabrication of prototypes in a range of sizes, styles, materials and colours. 3D printing is now accessible to the public and a basic fused deposition modelling (FDM) printer can be easily bought at a shopping mall.",

Of all the existing AM techniques, FDM, direct printing, injection printing, selective laser sintering and stereolithography are some of the most popular ones that are gaining significant momentum. There are several key benefits that AM offers over traditional manufacturing including cost, speed, quality, innovation\/transformation, and impact as summarised by Attaran. AM enables and facilitates production of moderate to mass quantities of products that can be customised individually and it is a powerful tool to reduce complexity in the supply chain.",

    "text": "FDM, also referred to as fused filament fabrication (FFF) was invented over 20 years ago. The acronyms FDM and FFF are both in common use within academic literature. After stereolithography, FDM is the second most commonly used 3D printing technique [12]. This technique is controlled by a rapid prototype (RP) computer, that can produce parts made of porous materials through the layer-by-layer manufacturing method [13]. FDM generally involves the generation of a digital design using a 3D design software, which is subsequently sliced into a series of laminations or layers. This layer data is communicated to the printer which reproduces the design layer-by-layer until the complete model is obtained. The mechanical properties of FDM printed parts depends on the material, the structural parameters (i.e. rasters angle, infill density, printing orientation, and stacking sequence), and manufacturing variables (i.e. printing speed, extrusion temperature and rate, layer time, nozzle transverse speed, and bed temperature) [14-17]. FDM RP has certain advantages such as control of the matrix architecture (shape, size, branching, geometry, interconnectivity, and orientation), producing a structure that can vary in design, and composition according to the material used. However, much research is being carried out to improve the printing quality control [18,19].",

    "text": "As a general scheme, the core principle of the FDM production method is simply to melt the raw material and facilitate the creation of new shapes. The material is made of a filament coil on a wheel that is driven into a temperature-controlled nozzle which heats it to a semiliquid. The nozzle accurately extrudes and guides the molten material to build a structural element layer by layer. This replicates the outlines of a layer that has been introduced into the FDM working system by the application programme. FDM begins with the virtual design of the part to be printed which is generated using a computer-aided design (CAD) software in a .stl format. Some of the most popular software packages used to produce this type of files are AutoCAD, FreeCAD, Autodesk Inventor, SolidWorks or Tinkercad. The .stl file is processed by a slicing or laminating programme which converts the design into printer- specific instructions so that the printer can understand the design. The .stl file is transformed into a .gcode file. The specifications necessary to be able to print the part, such as print speed, size of the print thread, temperature and layer height are selected in a slicer or slicing programme such as Slic3r and Cura.",

Thus, multi-factor coupling such as different printing temperatures, printing directions, printing paths, and layer thicknesses have been shown to influence the tensile strength, bending strength, crystallinity, and grain size of FDM printed parts [96]. The mechanical properties of the 3D printed pieces are limited by the weak interlamination bonding as well as the poor performance of raw filaments used [89]. Thus, temperature control can increase inter-layer bonding strength in FDM [97]. Printing parameters such as nozzle diameter, layer height, raster angle, and nozzle temperature have been shown to affect composite samples tensile strength, density, and production time [90]. FDM process parameters such as layer thickness, extruder temperature, filling structure, and occupancy rate can affect the mechanical properties in terms of tensile strength, elongation, and impact strength of 3D printed pieces [91]. Other important parameters to take into account are the infill and nozzle diameter [98]. These parameters affect the pore size and porosity of the FDM printed parts. Infill density has shown a considerable influence on the tensile strength and surface roughness of FDM printed parts [99,100]. Additionally, the size of the nozzle allows the extrusion of different thicknesses of materials [101]. The temperature and building orientation of the nozzle influences the relative density, flexural strength, tensile strength, breaking elongation and impact strength of the polymers [102]. Moreover, the layer thickness affects irreversible thermal strain and mechanical properties [103]. Recycling of FDM waste, which is nowadays fundamental in a circular economy perspective, can also change the mechanical properties of the pristine material [104]. FDM feedstock exists in the form of filament with an average diameter of 1.78 mm, although diameters as large as 3 mm can still be found [105]. The average diameter and its variance are important parameters that affect the extrusion process [106].",

    "text": "Chemical post-processing procedures consist of paintings, coatings, heating and\/or vapour deposition [190-193]. Thus, for example, novel post-processing techniques of FDM pieces to improve surface roughness and reduce heat absorption for high-temperature applications were developed by chemical treatment, drying and aluminium coating [194]. Other authors have proposed several economic and rapid strategies of chemical treatments with acetone-based solvents to modify printed ABS pieces to significantly improve their surface finish with minimal variations in dimensional accuracy [195,196]. Surface treatments with dichloromethane have been proposed to eliminate printing lines on polycarbonate components fabricated by FDM [197]. However, it is of note that the application of chemical post-processing methods to improve the surface finish of printed pieces obtained by FDM can modify thermal properties [191]. Mechanical their degradation and post-processing methods mainly include machining [198], abrasives [199], barrel finishing [200], sanding [201] and vibratory processes [190]. A novel post-processing tool, namely thermally assisted finishing tool (TAFT) has been designed and developed for thermally assisted finishing (TAF) of FDM built parts on CNC milling machines to improve their surface finish conditions [202]. The surface quality of FDM parts has also been enhanced by subjecting them to acetone chemical vapour smoothing laser-assisted finishing post-processing methods [189]. Improvements in surface roughness and dimensional accuracy of biomedical implants have been achieved by combining FDM, CVP and investment casting, which is a renowned process for producing dimensionally accurate and highly finished casts [203]. Partial dentures have been prepared with a synergistic combination of FDM assisted CVS patterns and conventional dental casting [204]. Very recently, laser polishing was shown to improve the surface quality, mechanical and thermal properties of FDM aluminium\/PLA composites [205]. These examples highlight the potential of post-processing techniques to improve one of the most important limitations of FDM, the poor surface quality or characteristic texture.",

    "text": "Experimental results have evidenced how material modifications have a strong impact on rheological behaviour, which has a key role in printability [126,187]. Thus, the printability of non-commonly used 3D printing filament materials such as PP can be improved by talc filling [187]. Printability and thus the quality of 3D printed pieces can change according to the PLA colour used [188]. Cuiffo et al. have shown that the FDM printing process results in chemical and structural changes in PLA [164]. Several materials with excellent mechanical properties such as ABS, PC, PEEK and HIPS need high printing temperatures and a hot bed [110,147,160]. Therefore, it is important to be aware of potential issues related to material transformations during printing, as well as the somewhat uncertain nature of commercial filaments [164].",

    "text": "Although FDM was developed more than 20 years ago and its great advantages have been studied in this review, this technology still has several limitations. The primary disadvantage of FDM is that it is currently limited to processing polymer-based materials [206]. Another handicap is the low printing speed of FDM that results in a low rate of production of the print samples in comparison with other AM techniques [207]. The imperfections in the final 3D pieces such as defects and anisotropy, rough surface finish, variations in the dimensions of printed parts, and dependence on processes used are other notable challenges using FDM [208]. Similar to other AM techniques, the material properties of 3D printing parts using FDM depend on printing conditions (e. g., speed, power, temperature, process). The accuracy of FDM prints depends on different factors such as the nozzle diameter, the filament material properties and the processing parameters used [209-211]. As such the accuracy of the 3D printed parts is affected by the processing parameters during the printing process because they can affect shrinkage, bonding and warping during cooling, which subsequently affects part assemblies [212-216]. The requirement for significant post-processing to bring the printed parts to the desired surface quality is another aspect that need consideration while using FDM. This is due to the fixed nozzle and feed diameter resulting in the layer-by-layer patterns of a predetermined thickness that can obscure fine features in the part depending on their dimension. Lastly, in comparison to other techniques such as stereolithography (SLA), digital light processing (DLP) and selective laser melting (SLM), FDM is not yet suitable to be adopted for large mass market fabrication primarily due to their inconsistency in part and material quality. Therefore, FDM is more suitable for small to medium scale production of complex non-safety critical components.",

The role of biomaterials here is to provide a 3D cell support that controls and guides localised tissue regeneration and provides potentially controllable cellular microenvironments similar to those in vivo [230,245]. Scaffolds are used as supports for the tissue growth of bone, cartilage, ligaments, skin, blood vessels, nerves and muscle [246]. Biodegradable scaffolds can be utilised to bioengineer entire organs by allowing the material to disintegrate as new tissue is generated [247].

This has many benefits like increased customisation for architects, reduced construction time, reduced manpower, and construction cost [278]. In 2014, WinSun, in China, was the first architectural company that constructed a group of houses using 3D printing [279]. The selection of appropriate AM technology for construction applications is dependent on the cost, printing time, accuracy, and available materials [278]. For printing ceramics materials and concrete, contour crafting is usually used as the preferred printing technology. However, the FDM technology requires the use of polymer materials such as novel thermoplastics such as PEI, polyaryletherketone (PAEK), and polyphenylsulfone (PPSU) [242]. These high-performance thermoplastics are increasingly in demand for industrial-grade FDM construction applications, as they are a suitable, cost-effective, and lightweight alternative to some metals such as stainless steel or aluminium. FDM technology can use a printing material composed of polymers and synthetic stones [278] or Lecce stone scraps [280] to produce original industrial and building products.",

    "text": "Although FDM technology is still developing, progress in printing speeds and new materials is broadening its potential applications, which range from 3D printing full scale buildings to complex human organs with nanoscale features. In biomedicine, FDM is already being trialled to manufacture scaffolds for tissue regeneration and reconstruction. 3D printing of functional organs known as bioprinting, is also rapidly advancing and offers a promising future. Research groups around the world are working on overcoming the current limitations regarding the creation of complete tissues and organs via FDM, which require effective structural architecture that also acts as a viable environment for cells. FDM is also making inroads in applications such as the fabrication of bone models, drug release in pharmacology, biosensors, laboratory hardware, organoids, laboratory models, surgical tools, dentistry, microdevices, microfluidics, electromagnetic induction shielding, automotive and aerospace engineering, occupational therapy, architecture, construction, acoustics, textile industry, personal protective equipment and many other fields are also actively harnessing the great potential of FDM. The furthest scientific advances in the field include the combination of FDM with other technologies such as HME and the use of smart materials in 4D printing to produce functional smart objects that can perform active functions, which has opened a broad range of new FDM application fields.",

The STL file of the model is then preprocessed using FDM software. This preprocessing consists of several important steps including determination of part orientation on the build volume, slicing into thin horizontal layers, selection of various FDM parameters, and generation of supports. A suitable part orientation of the STL model is important to minimize or eliminate supports and improve surface finish. Depending upon the type of FDM machine used, FDM process parameters may include raster width, build style, raster angle, air gap, nozzle tip size, model temperature, etc. For each sliced layer, the preprocessing software generates tool paths or build instructions for the liquefier head to create each layer. The preprocessed file of the model and supports, called Stratasys machine language (SML) file or CMB file in some FDM machines, is then sent to the FDM machine for part building.",

    "text": "Stratasys is the main provider, which dominates the FDM commercialized market. In 1992, the first FDM machine was named 3D Modeler. Since then, Stratasys has marketed various FDM machines: FDM1600, FDM1650, FDM2000, Prodigy Plus, FDM3000, FDM Titan, FDM Maxum, and FDM Vantage, with various sizes, build volumes, and material options. Currently, Stratasys uses the term 3D printers for its machines and uses its FDM technology in the uPrint series, Dimension series, and Fortus production series of 3D printers for direct digital manufacturing and precision rapid prototyping. In general, low-cost machines offer lower build volumes, quick set up, fewer options for materials and layer thickness, while higher cost machines provide bigger build volume, more options for materials and colors, and more options for changing layer thickness and process parameters to create parts with varying degree of accuracy and quality. For support removal, Stratasys offers two methods: soluble support technology, which dissolves the support in a water-based solution, and breakaway support technology, in which the supports are simply snapped off the final model. For more information on the latest systems, refer to the Stratasys website (3).",

Layer thickness refers to the distance traveled in the z-direction between successive layers, and has a direct effect on the build time and the surface quality of sloped surfaces. The value of selected slice height depends upon the type of FDM machine, model tip size, and type of FDM material used. The model tip size used on the FDM machine allows a specified layer thickness value. For example, in a FDM Vantage machine, a minimum layer thickness of 0.1778 mm can be used for a model tip size T10. Thicker layers require less build time, but with poor quality of the surface finish.",
